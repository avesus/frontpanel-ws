FrontPanel Web API Sample README
==============================

The sample can be simply opened in a browser (IE is not supported).

If you run a local FPoIP server using self-signed certificate (e.g
wss://localhost:9999/) then you need to open the corresponding HTTPS
URL (e.g. https://localhost:9999/) in the same browser, in order to
accept the certificate, as you won't have any possibility to do it
when connecting via WebSocket.
